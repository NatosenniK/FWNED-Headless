  Converting FWNED To Gatsby

## Transitioning to Gatsby

### Why We're Moving to Gatsby

After thorough analysis and consideration, we've decided to transition our existing WordPress website to Gatsby. This strategic move is driven by our commitment to providing an exceptional user experience through increased website speed and enhanced reliability. Key reasons for this shift include:

#### Performance Optimization

- Gatsby's static generation ensures that our site loads faster, offering an immediate improvement in performance. This not only enhances user satisfaction but also positively impacts our search engine rankings.

#### Improved Reliability

- By leveraging Gatsby's build-time data fetching, we eliminate the risk of runtime errors and server downtime, resulting in a more reliable website for our users.

#### Modern Tech Stack

- Transitioning to Gatsby allows us to utilize a modern, JavaScript-based stack, enabling us to tap into the powerful ecosystem of React for a more dynamic and interactive user experience.

#### Enhanced Developer Experience

- Gatsby's developer-friendly environment accelerates development cycles, facilitates easier updates, and improves our team's productivity through hot reloading, comprehensive documentation, and a supportive community.

#### Scalability

- As our content and traffic grow, Gatsby's architecture ensures that our site remains fast and efficient, without the need for complex scaling operations.

By adopting Gatsby, we're not just upgrading our technology; we're investing in a future-proof platform that aligns with our vision for a faster, more reliable, and user-centric website.
